# Project2

## Phase 0: Set Up Project Environment

To set up this project, I first set up GitHub actions. Then, I made a project and created some to do items.

## Phase 1: Device Module

### Json Schema for Device Module

The json schema for the device module is as follows:
1) Entry Title: This is used to name the entry you are logging
2) Device Name: This is a string value that includes 
3) Data Entry: This requires the user to input the information associated with the device they chose
4) Unit: This is the unit associated with the information the user put in

This is a sample entry:
